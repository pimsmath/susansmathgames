  I love these puzzles! They are visually appealing, with bright colours and distinct shapes rather than numbers or letters; they require puzzlers to be very clear about which rules they are using; there are thousands of solutions for each level; and solutions can be found via many approaches.
Children are often quicker than adults at finding solutions,which makes them feel justifiably proud of their abilities."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.81.0"><meta name=ROBOTS content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/dist/main.css_5c99d70a7725bacd4c701e995b969fea.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/local.css><meta property="og:title" content="Latin & Euler squares"><meta property="og:description" content="An Euler square, almost completed.

the idea, although you might want to start them with 3x3 grids.  Once they

a Latin square. Examples include Futoshiki, Kenken, Towers, Neighbours, and
Kakurasu.  Sudoku fans will find the idea familiar, as Sudoku is a combination
of Latin squares.</p><ul><li><p><a href=/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/about-Latin-squares-.pdf target=_blank>Latin square</a>
puzzles
are best done with pieces of coloured paper or craft foam, as everyone seems
to find colour attractive and non-threatening.  They can be done with just
numbers or letters, but I don&rsquo;t recommend it to start with.</p></li><li><p><a href=/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/about-Euler-squares-.pdf target=_blank>Euler squares</a>
are
Latin squares with two attributes, say colour and shape.  They are also
known as Graeco-Latin squares because Euler, who seems to have invented
them, used two types of letters, Greek and Roman, in each square.  That is
really hard to see!  It was once a popular game to construct Euler squares
with regular playing cards, using four cards (say Ace, Joker, Queen, King)
in each of the four suits.</p></li></ul><figure class="right half"><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset="/posts/latin-euler-squares/images/3x3-Latin-square_hu39958c768e14df377cc81166c57d2d51_778352_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w

rhombus in each colour. Then I ask the students to sort out the pieces, without
giving any suggestions about how to do that. If someone seems uncertain what to
do in the face of the deliberately vague instructions, I ask them to figure out
if any pieces are missing. That seems to provide enough direction to get
them going. It’s always interesting to see how many sort by colour, how
many by shape, and how many use both at the same time, which is
essentially level 1 of the Euler puzzles.</p><p>Unlike the way I in which introduce other puzzles to classes, I usually put the
rules for these – one level at a time – on the board, as the first students
complete each level. That way each student can double-check the rules that s/he
is currently using. I think it is useful for students to see the progression in
complexity, and for them to realise that the rules are what makes the game. If I
don’t put up the next rule quickly enough, students will often suggest it.</p><p>Getting the idea across for the lowest level you start at often requires several
re-statements, as some people oversimplify and others make it more complicated
than necessary. I have discovered that in any age group there are people who can
hear a rule and proceed to use it, others who can read it and proceed to use it,
others who read a rule and need to re-state it in their own words before using
it, and some who need to hear the re-statement from their peers.</p><ul class=pa0><li class=list><a href=/tags/puzzles class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">puzzles</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/posts/rectangles-2/>Rectangles</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-blue bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href>&copy; Susan's Math Games 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
