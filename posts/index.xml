Having only five pieces instead of the classic seven makes them much less intimidating for many people. Students who enjoy these puzzles may be encouraged to try the classic tangrams.
Making the pieces I use craft foam because it is easy to handle and lasts very well, but if you are in a hurry, you could make them out of cardstock.</description></item><item><title>Streamers</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/streamers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 04:32:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/streamers/</guid><description>Streamers has been popular with everyone from grade 4 on up. Here are the demonstration puzzles to help you get started.
To play, each student will need a set of 16 pieces: squares, triangles, circles, and rhombuses each in blue, green, orange and purple.
Here are the puzzles themselves: 1&amp;amp;2, 3&amp;amp;4, 5&amp;amp;6, 7&amp;amp;8, 9&amp;amp;10, 11&amp;amp;12</description></item><item><title>Towers</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/towers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 04:10:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/towers/</guid><description>This is a wonderful puzzle which requires a person to think in three dimensions. Most people seem to find it easier (and more fun) to start by working with physical pieces on a grid. I&amp;rsquo;ve introduced it to classes as young as grade 5, and to individual students younger than that.
Here are:

Here is another solved puzzle, and here is a description of the rules together with a very easy worked example.
A great way to learn to play Magnets is to use physical pieces, as shown in the photo.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief outline of the way I introduce the game to people from about 8 years old to 80. If you would prefer a much more detailed approach, with many examples, go to page 30 of the Nov 2016 issue of The Variable.</description></item><item><title>Computer-related</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/computer-related/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2014 23:54:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/computer-related/</guid><description>Digital pictures Have you ever wondered how computers and all things digital handle pictures? This simplified version can be turned into an open-ended game.
Error Detection Free your inner mathemagician! Mystify your audience! Give them lots of time to try to figure out what you are doing – you may be surprised by which student does figure it out. This game is based on one method that computers check whether transmitted information might have errors.</description></item><item><title>Futoshiki</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/futoshiki/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2014 19:59:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/futoshiki/</guid><description>Can you figure out the rules from this solved puzzle?

Here are some variations that use dominoes. The game itself is appealing, gives students practice with addition and subtraction, and can form a good introduction to probability.
The grids come in three sizes, using 9, 16, and 25 dominoes respectively. They are designed for 1&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; dominoes. You can make your own from the given template using construction paper or plastic foam.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played this with students as young as grade 2.</description></item><item><title>Pentominoes</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/pentominoes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 21:35:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/pentominoes/</guid><description>Pentominoes have been around as puzzles for over 100 years, although they didn&amp;rsquo;t get the name &amp;ldquo;pentominoes&amp;rdquo; until 1953.
Each pentomino is made of 5 squares that are attached to each other on at least one side. Try to figure out what they must look like, then check to see you have all 12 pentominoes. They are named after the letter they most look like. Here is the set with their names.</description></item><item><title>Geometry</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/geometry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 22:43:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/geometry/</guid><description>Geometry is a huge part of mathematics, although it often gets passed over in the school curriculum. Here are some great games and puzzles that help build geometric intuition. Some support more formal mathematical study as well.
Pentominoes
Make two and three dimensional shapes from drinking straws. The three-dimensional shapes are particularly eye-catching. (Small hands will require some help with those.) You can also create towers using the straws - the most stable are built from triangles.</description></item><item><title>Arithmetic &amp; algebra</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/arithmetic-algebra-games/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 21:24:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/arithmetic-algebra-games/</guid><description>15-Scratch and 24-Scratch are great games for almost anywhere you have a few spare minutes. You don&amp;rsquo;t need anything at all to play them, but it helps if you have something to write on and something to write with.
A more complicated version allows more operations and can entertain people for hours. If you write the numbers from 1 to 100 on a board with space beside each one, students can put up their solutions over several days.</description></item><item><title>Kakurasu</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/kakurasu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 02:58:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/kakurasu/</guid><description>This puzzle is essentially a Latin square with addition. All you really need to know is how to add single-digit numbers, although subtraction is also useful. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve spend a few minutes sorting out which numbers mean what, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to start puzzling!
Can you figure out the rules from this solved puzzle?

Level 1 involves only 13 dominoes. These are very popular with the K-3 crowd. Some children may need a little encouragement to get started: Which pieces do we know for sure?</description></item><item><title>Hidato</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/hidato/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2014 23:41:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/hidato/</guid><description>Can you figure out the rules from this solved puzzle? Check here to see if you&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out.
This is one of most accessible of all the puzzles. All you need to be able to do is count!
It&amp;rsquo;s fun for primary students to have coloured counters to put in the blanks. This also reduces any concern they might feel about having a number in the wrong place, as it is very easy to fix.</description></item><item><title>Latin &amp; Euler squares</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/latin-euler-squares/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 23:46:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/latin-euler-squares/</guid><description>An Euler square, almost completed.
I love these puzzles! They are visually appealing, with bright colours and distinct shapes rather than numbers or letters; they require puzzlers to be very clear about which rules they are using; there are thousands of solutions for each level; and solutions can be found via many approaches.
Children are often quicker than adults at finding solutions,which makes them feel justifiably proud of their abilities.</description></item><item><title>Rectangles</title><link>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/rectangles-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 22:07:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/rectangles-2/</guid><description>Can you figure out the rules of the game from its solution?
Rectangles connects arithmetic and geometry. For students who have already started multiplication and division this puzzle makes factoring tangible. For students who are just learning about multiplication, the puzzle provides a concrete introduction to multiplication as repeated addition.
