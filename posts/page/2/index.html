Each pentomino is made of 5 squares that are attached to each other on at least one side. Try to figure out what they must look like, then check to see you have all 12 pentominoes. They are named after the letter they most look like. Here is the set with their names.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/geometry/ class="link black dim">Geometry</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Geometry is a huge part of mathematics, although it often gets passed over in the school curriculum. Here are some great games and puzzles that help build geometric intuition. Some support more formal mathematical study as well.
Make two-and three-dimensional shapesfrom drinking straws. The three-dimensional shapes are particularly eye-catching. (Small hands will require some help with those.) You can also create towers using the straws – the most stable are built from triangles.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/other-games/ class="link black dim">Other games</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Here is a selection of other games and activities that involve mathematical thinking. While some are framed as puzzles, they seem different in kind from those in the Puzzles section. Some have many solutions, others are quite open-ended, leading to bigger questions.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/arithmetic-algebra-games/ class="link black dim">Arithmetic & algebra</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">15-Scratch and 24-Scratch are great games for almost anywhere you have a few spare minutes. You don&rsquo;t need anything at all to play them, but it helps if you have something to write on and something to write with.
A more complicated version allows more operations and can entertain people for hours. If you write the numbers from 1 to 100 on a board with space beside each one, students can put up their solutions over several days.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/kakurasu/ class="link black dim">Kakurasu</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This puzzle is essentially a Latin squarewith addition. All you really need to know is how to add single-digit numbers, although subtraction is also useful. Once you’ve spend a few minutes sorting out which numbers mean what, you’re ready to start puzzling!
Can you figure out the rules from the solved puzzle?

Level 1 involves only 13 dominoes. These are very popular with the K-3 crowd. Some children may need a little encouragement to get started: Which pieces do we know for sure?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/on-line-resources/ class="link black dim">On-line resources</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"></div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/posts/hidato/ class="link black dim">Hidato</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is one of most accessible of all the puzzles. All you need to be able to do is count!
It’s fun for primary students to have coloured counters to put in the blanks. This also reduces any concern they might feel about having a number in the wrong place, as it is very easy to fix.

They are visually appealing, with bright colours and distinct shapes rather than numbers or letters; they require puzzlers to be very clear about which rules they are using; there are thousands of solutions for each level; and solutions can be found via many approaches.
Children are often quicker than adults at finding solutions,which makes them feel justifiably proud of their abilities. Even kindergarten students pick up on the idea, although you might want to start them with 3×3 grids.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=/susansmathgames/posts/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/susansmathgames/posts/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/susansmathgames/posts/>1</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/susansmathgames/posts/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/susansmathgames/posts/page/3/>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/susansmathgames/posts/page/4/>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/susansmathgames/posts/page/3/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/susansmathgames/posts/page/4/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-blue bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://pimsmath.github.io/susansmathgames/>&copy; Susan's Math Games 2021</a><div></div></div></footer><script src=/susansmathgames/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
