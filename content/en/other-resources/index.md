There is currently considerable interest in developing logical/mathematical
games, which is wonderful!

### Stores
  * [Best games](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/commercial-games1.pdf): an
    annotated list of some of the best hands-on games that I’ve found.  Some
    games are just better in physical form than on-line.  The list is updated
    periodically as I find new games and try them out on people.
  * [Stores](/stores/): an annotated list of some stores in British Columbia
    which carry logical/mathematical games.  If you know of a good store, please
    let me know so I can pass it on.
  * [Quick start](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/summer-fun.pdf): a list of some
    accessible on-line or downloadable puzzles.  I've indicated the approximate
    appropriate age level.
