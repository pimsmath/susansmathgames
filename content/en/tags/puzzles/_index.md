These pages are meant to provide an introduction to some of the most easily
accessible logical/mathematical puzzles in a form that is easy to download and
print.

Many of these puzzles need only paper & pencil, while others are physical.  I
use the brightly-coloured plastic craft foam for the latter.  Look for it in
dollar stores, craft stores, office supply stores, and department stores with a
crafts section.  It takes a lot of careful cutting to make class sets â€“ my mother
has been a tremendous help!

If you are a teacher, [here](/classroom-introductions/) is a description of an
effective way to introduce most of these puzzles to your class.
