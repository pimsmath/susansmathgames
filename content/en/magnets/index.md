  Can you figure out the rules from this (mostly) solved puzzle?<a id="set-post-thumbnail" class="thickbox" title="Set featured image" href="/wp-admin/media-upload.php?post_id=712&type=image&TB_iframe=1"><img loading="lazy" class="attachment-266x266 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Magnets-850x1024-249x300.jpg" alt="Magnets (850x1024)" width="399" height="480" /></a>

Here is [another solved puzzle][1],Â  and here is a description of [the rules][2] together with a very easy worked example.

A great way to learn to play Magnets is to use physical pieces, as shown in the photo.

Here are:

  * a description of [what&#8217;s needed][3]
  * a set of [easy puzzles][4] (and [solutions][5])
  * a set of [medium puzzles][6] (and [solutions][7])
  * a set of [more difficult puzzles][8] (and [solutions][9])

If you would like examples of some useful types of logic, here is a [step-by-step solution][10] for an easy puzzle and one [for a medium puzzle][11].

Here is a selection of pencil-and-paper puzzles, 30 of each:

  * 6&#215;5 [easy][12], [medium][13], and [harder][14]
  * 7&#215;7 [medium][15]
  * 8&#215;7 [medium][16]
  * 10&#215;9 [medium][17] and [harder][18]

And you can always play on-line at <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/magnets.html" target="_blank">Simon Tatham&#8217;s Portable Puzzles</a>.
