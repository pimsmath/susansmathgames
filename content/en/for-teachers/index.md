> _Do not keep children to their studies by compulsion but by play._  – Plato

Not everything can be learned in an atmosphere of play, but the more often we
can bring effective play to our classrooms, the better! Students love it when
they think they are getting away with something by playing games instead of
doing “real” math. What they don’t realise is just how much mathematical
thinking they are developing by playing these games.  And of course, many of the
analytical skills we develop by solving puzzles are useful in other parts of our
lives.

[Here](/classroom-introductions/) is a general description of a technique I've
found highly effective for introducing most of the puzzles on this site.

For detailed discussions of a number of games that have been very successful in
many classrooms, visit the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ journal, [The
Variable](http://smts.ca/the-variable/):

  * In the [June 2016 issue](http://smts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Variable-June-2016.pdf), I describe domino puzzles and the game of Rectangles.
  * In the  [August 2016 issue](http://smts.ca/content/uploads/2016/04/The-Variable-2016-August.pdf), Hidato and variations on Latin squares using colour and shape are highlighted.
  * In the [November 2016 issue](http://smts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Variable-2016-November.pdf) you will find an in-depth description of how I introduce the game of Set to students of all ages, along with several variations that have proven popular.
  * In the [March/April 2017 issue](http://smts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Variable-2017-March-April.pdf), I describe the difference triangle, which is a puzzle that can easily  be used to fill a spare 10 minutes for individuals or the whole class.
  * There is a less-detailed discussion about a bigger selection of games in
    [volume 18 of Pi in the Sky](https://media.pims.math.ca/pi_in_sky/pi18.pdf)
    (page 21), published by the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical
    Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca).

### Classroom visits

If you are a teacher or principal in or near the Kootenay region of British
Columbia and are interested in having me come to your school to share some
mathematical games with your students, please [contact me](/contact-me/).

[Science World's](https://www.scienceworld.ca/sis) program, Scientists and
Innovators in the School, covers my expenses for classroom visits, which are
absolutely free for the school.



### Professional development workshops

The newly-revised mathematics curriculum in BC may have some teachers scrambling
for classroom material.  My favourite workshops include:

  * The use of games in developing mathematical habits of mind
  * Building geometric sense through origami
  * Problem-solving using geometrical constructions (compass and straightedge)
  * The use of fraction bars to solve story problems in any grade.

I'll happily tailor a workshop for your group. [Contact me](/contact-me/) to
find out more.
