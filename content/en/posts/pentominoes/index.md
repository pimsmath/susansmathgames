Pentominoes have been around as puzzles for over 100 years, although they
didn't get the name "pentominoes" until 1953.

Each pentomino is made of 5 squares that are attached to each other on at least
one side.  Try to figure out what they must look like, then check to see you
have all 12 pentominoes.  They are named after the letter they most look like. 
Here is the set with their
[names](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pentomino-names.pdf).

Make your own pentominoes  [one set at a
time](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/all-12-pentominoes.pdf) or [many sets at the
same time](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mult-copies-each-letter-pento.pdf), where
each pentomino can be printed on a different colour of paper.

Here are some [pentomino
puzzles](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pentomino-puzzles.pdf) from easy to hard,
and a [grid](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-inch-grid.pdf) so that you can make
up your own puzzles.

And here is a selection of [further
pursuits](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pentomino-pursuits.pdf), including more
tiling puzzles and some mathematical properties you can study using pentominoes

There are lots of variations on the idea, including tetrominoes (four squares)
and hexominoes (six), using triangles or hexagons instead of squares.  There are
computer games and board games based on the same idea (including Soma and
Blockout).  Tetris is a well-known 3-dimensional variant.
