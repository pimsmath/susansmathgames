These puzzles come in four levels.  To make it easier to keep track within a level I photocopy the puzzles (double-sided) on different colours of paper, say puzzle 1 and 2 on blue, 3 and 4 on yellow, etc.

<a title="level 1 dom puz" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/level-1-domino-puzzles.pdf" target="_blank">Level 1 </a>involves only 13 dominoes.  These are very popular with the K-3 crowd. Some children may need a little encouragement to get started:  _Which pieces do we know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for sure</span>?  
_ 

<a title="level 2 dom puz" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/level-2-domino-puzzles.pdf" target="_blank">Level 2</a> involves 18 dominoes, which is more challenging.  People from about grade 4 and up have enjoyed this level.

<a title="level 3 dom puz" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/level-3-domino-puzzles-.pdf" target="_blank">Level 3</a> and <a title="level 4 dom puz" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/level-4-domino-puzzles.pdf" target="_blank">level 4</a> involve all 28 dominoes.  Serious puzzle fiends of all ages can get some exercise with these!

Here are the templates if you want to **make your own dominoes** for <a title="level 1 dominoes" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dominoes-for-level-1.pdf" target="_blank">level 1</a> and <a title="level 2 dominoes" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dominoes-for-level-2.pdf" target="_blank">level 2</a>.  You could make them from heavy coloured paper, but I prefer plastic foam: it&#8217;s inexpensive, long-lasting, and light-weight.  It comes in many different colours, too, so students can keep their pieces separate from those of their neighbours.

Level 3 & 4 puzzles get too large for easy printing of the puzzles with the 1&#8243; x 2&#8243; pieces, so I&#8217;ve made the puzzles of a size to use the sets of small dominoes you can often find in dollar stores. Here is the template in case you want to make a  <a title="full set dominoes" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/full-set-dominoes.pdf" target="_blank">full set</a>, though.

Students who have completed all the puzzles from level 1 or 2 might like to **make their own puzzles** for their classmates.  Here is a <a title="DIY domino puzzles" href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DIY-domino-puzzles.pdf" target="_blank">grid</a> for them to work with.
