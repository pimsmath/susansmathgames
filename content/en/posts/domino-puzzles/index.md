These puzzles come in four levels.  To make it easier to keep track within a
level I photocopy the puzzles (double-sided) on different colours of paper, say
puzzle 1 and 2 on blue, 3 and 4 on yellow, etc.

* [Level 1](images/level-1-domino-puzzles.pdf) involves only 13 dominoes.  These
  are very popular with the K-3 crowd. Some children may need a little
  encouragement to get started:  _Which pieces do we know __for sure___?  
* [Level 2](images/level-2-domino-puzzles.pdf) involves 18 dominoes, which is
  more challenging.  People from about grade 4 and up have enjoyed this level.
* [Level 3](images/level-3-domino-puzzles-.pdf) and [Level
  4](images/level-4-domino-puzzles.pdf) involve all 28 dominoes.  Serious puzzle
  fiends of all ages can get some exercise with these!

Here are the templates if you want to **make your own dominoes** for
[level 1](images/dominoes-for-level-1.pdf) and [level 2](
images/dominoes-for-level-2.pdf) You could make them from heavy coloured paper,
but I prefer plastic foam: it's inexpensive, long-lasting, and
light-weight.  It comes in many different colours, too, so students can keep
their pieces separate from those of their neighbours.

Level 3 & 4 puzzles get too large for easy printing of the puzzles with the
1" x 2" pieces, so I've made the puzzles of a size to use the sets of small
dominoes you can often find in dollar stores. Here is the template
in case you want to make a [full set](
images/full-set-dominoes.pdf) though.

Students who have completed all the puzzles from level 1 or 2 might like to
**make their own puzzles** for their classmates.  Here is a [grid](
images/DIY-domino-puzzles.pdf) for them to work with.
