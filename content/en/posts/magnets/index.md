Here is [another solved puzzle][1],Â  and here is a description of [the rules][2]
together with a very easy worked example.

A great way to learn to play Magnets is to use physical pieces, as shown in the
photo.

Here are:

  * A description of [what's needed][3]
  * A set of [easy puzzles][4] (and [solutions][5])
  * A set of [medium puzzles][6] (and [solutions][7])
  * A set of [more difficult puzzles][8] (and [solutions][9])

If you would like examples of some useful types of logic, here is a
[step-by-step solution][10] for an easy puzzle and one [for a medium
puzzle][11].

Here is a selection of pencil-and-paper puzzles, 30 of each:

  * 6x5 [easy][12], [medium][13], and [harder][14]
  * 7x7 [medium][15]
  * 8x7 [medium][16]
  * 10x9 [medium][17] and [harder][18]

And you can always play on-line at [Simon Tatham's Portable
Puzzles](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/magnets.html).
