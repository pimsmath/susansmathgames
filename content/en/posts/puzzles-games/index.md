<p style="text-align: left;">
  These pages are meant to provide an introduction to some of the most easily accessible logical/mathematical puzzles in a form that is easy to download and print.  <em><br /> </em>
</p>

Many of these puzzles need only paper & pencil, while others are physical.  I use the brightly-coloured plastic craft foam for the latter.  Look for it in dollar stores, craft stores, office supply stores, and department stores with a crafts secton.  It takes a lot of careful cutting to make class sets &#8211; my mother has been a tremendous help!

Hover over the Puzzles tab above for a drop-down menu of puzzles I&#8217;ve used in classrooms and math fairs.

If you are a teacher, [here][1] is a description of an effective way to introduce most of these puzzles to your class.
