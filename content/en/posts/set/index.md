This is a wonderful game with many variations and lots of underlying mathematical ideas.  It can be played cooperatively or competitively &#8211; or both, by working together in teams to compete with other teams.  Children often master the rules more quickly than do adults, which adds to their fun.

Here&#8217;s a brief outline of the way I <a title="introducing Set" href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Set-instructions.pdf" target="_blank">introduce the game</a> to people from about 8 years old to 80.  If you would prefer a much more detailed approach, with many examples, go to page 30 of <a href="http://smts.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Variable-2016-November.pdf" target="_blank">the Nov 2016 issue</a> of _The Variable_.

For children under 8, try introducing the basic rule of Set by using only the solid colours. It&#8217;s surprising how quickly they will pick it up. Then you can add the rest of the cards to include all the shadings.

Here is a list of Set <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Set-variations-for-website.pdf" target="_blank">vari</a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Set-variations-for-website.pdf" target="_blank">ations</a> that have been successful with all ages.

You can find the game of Set at finer toy stores for about $16. Or <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DIY-Set-cards.pdf" target="_blank">make your own,</a> using simpler shapes such as circle, triangle, rectangle.  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DIY-Set-cards-legal-size.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a version on legal-sized paper.
