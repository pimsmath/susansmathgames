Have you ever wondered how computers and all things digital handle pictures?

## [Error Detection](./images/error-detection.pdf)
Free your inner mathemagician!  Mystify your audience!  Give them lots of time to try to figure out what you are doing &#8211; you may be surprised by which student does figure it out.  This game is based on one method that computers check whether transmitted information might have errors.

Here is another game that involves a carefully chosen sequence of moves.  People
of all ages seem to enjoy this one.  Here is some [added
