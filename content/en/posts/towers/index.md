This is a wonderful puzzle which requires a person to think in three dimensions. Most people seem to find it easier (and more fun) to start by working with physical pieces on a grid.  I&#8217;ve introduced it to classes as young as grade 5, and to individual students younger than that.

&nbsp;

Here are:

  * a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/manipulatives-grid.pdf" target="_blank">description of pieces and a template for the grid</a>
  * the process I use to <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-instructions.pdf" target="_blank">introduce Towers</a> to a group, which you might also use to help you figure it out for yourself
  * the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/step-by-step-towers-solution.pdf" target="_blank">step-by-step solution</a> for the example in the introduction
  * a set of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-easy.pdf" target="_blank">Easy 4&#215;4 puzzles,</a> which can be solved using the blocks
  * a set of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-medium.pdf" target="_blank">Medium 4&#215;4 puzzles</a>, which can also be solved using the blocks
  * a set of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-hard.pdf" target="_blank">Hard 4&#215;4 puzzles</a>, for which you might want to get out a pencil and eraser, although they can be solved using the blocks
  * a set of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-5x5-easy.pdf" target="_blank">Easy 5&#215;5 puzzles </a>

I&#8217;ll post more 5&#215;5 puzzles soon!
