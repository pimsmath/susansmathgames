This is a wonderful puzzle which requires a person to think in three
dimensions. Most people seem to find it easier (and more fun) to start by
working with physical pieces on a grid.  I've introduced it to classes as
young as grade 5, and to individual students younger than that.


Here are:

  * A [description of pieces and a template for the
    grid](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/manipulatives-grid.pdf)
  * The process I use to [introduce
    Towers](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-instructions.pdf) to a group,
    which you might also use to help you figure it out for yourself
  * The [step-by-step
    solution](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/step-by-step-towers-solution.pdf) for
    the example in the introduction
  * A set of [Easy 4x4 puzzles](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-easy.pdf)
    which can be solved using the blocks
  * A set of [Medium 4x4
    puzzles](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-medium.pdf), which can also
    be solved using the blocks
  * A set of [Hard 4x4
    puzzles](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-4x4-hard.pdf), for which you
    might want to get out a pencil and eraser, although they can be solved using
    the blocks
  * A set of [Easy 5x5 puzzles](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Towers-5x5-easy.pdf)


I'll post more 5x5 puzzles soon!

You will find many puzzles of varying sizes and degrees of difficulty at [Simon
Tatham's Portable

also a commercial version called "Utopia".
