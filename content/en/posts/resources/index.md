There is currently considerable interest in developing logical/mathematical games, which is wonderful!

  * <a title="commercial games" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/commercial-games1.pdf" target="_blank">Best games</a>: an annotated list of some of the best hands-on games that I&#8217;ve found.  Some games are just better in physical form than on-line.  The list is updated periodically as I find new games and try them out on people.

  * <a title="stores" href="/stores/" target="_blank">Stores:</a> an annotated list of some stores in British Columbia which carry logical/mathematical games.  If you know of a good store, please let me know so I can pass it on.

  *  <a title="on-line resources" href="/on-line-resources/" target="_blank">Websites</a>: there are many places to play on-line games and a few where you can download printable pages.  If you have a favourite site, please let me know so I can add to this list.

  * <a title="summer fun" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/summer-fun.pdf" target="_blank">Quick start</a>: a list of some accessible on-line or downloadable puzzles.  I&#8217;ve indicated the approximate appropriate age level.
