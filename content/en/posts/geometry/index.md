Geometry is a huge part of mathematics, although it often gets passed over in
the school curriculum.  Here are some great games and puzzles that help build
geometric intuition.  Some support more formal mathematical study as well.

Make [two and three dimensional
shapes](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/straw-constructions.pdf) from drinking
straws.  The three-dimensional shapes are particularly eye-catching.  (Small
hands will require some help with those.)  You can also create towers using the
straws - the most stable are built from triangles.

[Pentominoes](/posts/pentominoes/) are a terrific source of fun and games.  They can
also be used to study a wide variety of mathematical properties.

[Tangrams](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tangram-template1.pdf) are a very old
form of puzzle.  Make your own classic set, then try to create some [birds and
animals](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tangrams-animals.pdf) There are many more
tangram puzzles available on-line and in books.

For K-3 students, I would recommend [five-piece tangrams](/posts/five-piece-tangrams/)
instead of the classic seven-piece puzzles.

If you have a compass and straight-edge, make your own [Magic
Egg](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/magic-egg.pdf), then see what kinds of birds
you can hatch from your egg.
