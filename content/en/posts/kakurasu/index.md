This puzzle is essentially a [Latin
square](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/about-Latin-squares-.pdf) with addition. All
you really need to know is how to add single-digit numbers, although subtraction
is also useful. Once you've spend a few minutes sorting out which numbers mean
what, you're ready to start puzzling!

Once you've mastered these, you might enjoy creating your own puzzles: just
start with the tick and X-marks, work out the sums, then decide how many of the
sums to give as clues.

I think this puzzle was invented by Otto Janko.  Check out [his
website](https://www.janko.at/Spiele/index.htm) for this and many other
intriguing games.

Here is another [on-line Kaurasu generator](https://www.math.edu.pl/kakurasu). 
Although the site is in Polish. it's pretty self-explanatory!
