Having only five pieces instead of the classic seven makes them much less intimidating for many people. Students who enjoy these puzzles may be encouraged to try the classic tangrams.
Making the pieces I use craft foam because it is easy to handle and lasts very well, but if you are in a hurry, you could make them out of cardstock.</description></item><item><title>Rectangles</title><link>/posts/rectangles-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 22:07:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rectangles-2/</guid><description>Can you figure out the rules of the game from its solution?
