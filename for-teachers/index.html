can bring effective play to our classrooms, the better! Students love it when
they think they are getting away with something by playing games instead of
doing “real” math. What they don’t realise is just how much mathematical
thinking they are developing by playing these games. And of course, many of the
analytical skills we develop by solving puzzles are useful in other parts of our
lives.</p><p><a href=/classroom-introductions/>Here</a>
is a general description of a technique I&rsquo;ve
found highly effective for introducing most of the puzzles on this site.</p><p>For detailed discussions of a number of games that have been very successful in
many classrooms, visit the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ journal, <a href=http://smts.ca/the-variable/ target=_blank>The
