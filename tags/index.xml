Many of these puzzles need only paper &amp;amp; pencil, while others are physical. I use the brightly-coloured plastic craft foam for the latter. Look for it in dollar stores, craft stores, office supply stores, and department stores with a crafts section. It takes a lot of careful cutting to make class sets â€“ my mother has been a tremendous help!</description></item><item><title>Games</title><link>https://susansmathgames.ca/tags/games/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 21:24:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://susansmathgames.ca/tags/games/</guid><description>Here is a selection of other games and activities that involve mathematical thinking. While some are framed as puzzles, they seem different in kind from those in the Puzzles section. Some have many solutions, others are quite open-ended, leading to bigger questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
