Having only five pieces instead of the classic seven makes them much less intimidating for many people. Students who enjoy these puzzles may be encouraged to try the classic tangrams.
Making the pieces I use craft foam because it is easy to handle and lasts very well, but if you are in a hurry, you could make them out of cardstock.</description></item><item><title>Domino puzzles</title><link>susansmathgames/posts/domino-puzzles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 18:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>susansmathgames/posts/domino-puzzles/</guid><description>These puzzles come in four levels. To make it easier to keep track within a level I photocopy the puzzles (double-sided) on different colours of paper, say puzzle 1 and 2 on blue, 3 and 4 on yellow, etc.
Level 1 involves only 13 dominoes. These are very popular with the K-3 crowd. Some children may need a little encouragement to get started: Which pieces do we know for sure?</description></item></channel></rss>
